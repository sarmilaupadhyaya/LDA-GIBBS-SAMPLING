# LDA GIBBS SAMPLING #

In this PROJECT, i implementED LDA and try it out on a corpus.

Also, I implemented a Gibbs sampler which resamples a topic for each word in the
corpus according to the probability distribution in formula [5] of Griffiths
& Steyvers (2004). Initialize the topic assignments by choosing a topic uni-
formly at random for each token in the corpus.
